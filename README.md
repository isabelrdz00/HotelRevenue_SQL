# Hotel Booking Analysis
### Overview
This project involves creating a hotel booking database using SQL and then importing the data into Power BI for future visualizations and data analysis.

## Project Description
### Data Integration:
- I utilized SQL to create a consolidated database by combining data from different sources, such as hotel booking details from 2018, 2019, and 2020.
- Data transformations were applied using SQL queries to format and prepare the data for visualization and analysis.

### SQL Query Development:
- I wrote SQL scripts to join tables, calculate revenue, and group data by specific categories like arrival dates and hotel types.
- The SQL scripts include operations such as JOIN, UNION, and GROUP BY for combining and summarizing information.
- Data Import and Visualization:
- The final dataset was imported into Power BI.
- The database is structured in a way that it can serve as the foundation for future visualizations, helping to derive insights on hotel occupancy, booking trends, and revenue performance.
